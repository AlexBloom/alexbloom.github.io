            <p class="">Remote video sessions that come in several flavors: <br>
              Critique: in which you can get critique or second opinions on your brand, design system, prototypes, feature concepts or existing app. <br>
              Counsel: in which I act as a sounding board for your design process or investments in design hiring.

            <p class="">In many organizations, teams struggle to generate effective output because they're too focused on output. Team members often believe different aspects of a process have more value but don't often have a forum or tools to express this. I offer in-house workshops to help uncover these individually-held beliefs and foster healthy dialogue within product teams to yield greater productivity and solution quality.</p>

<p>Most recently, I ran a design practice with Spencer Harrison called Morf Studio for the entirety of 2016. We tried a lot, failed a lot, and learned a lot.
  I spent the previous three years freelancing independently, working on brands, print pieces, physical spaces, websites, and apps&mdash;working directly with my clients and partnering with studios and agencies.</p>
<p>Before that, I worked for a number of digital and graphic design firms and advertising agencies. Notably, Bluecadet and The Heads of State.</p>

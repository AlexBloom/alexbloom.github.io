<p>I’m going to tell you a story about Carrboro, North Carolina. It’s a small town, sister to Chapel Hill. It hosts a myriad of Graduate Students &amp; Baristas, Small Business Owners &amp; Employees, Punks &amp; Anarchists, Hippies &amp; Musicians, carpenters &amp; contractors: all living in a tiny southern oasis where the internet is slow and time moves slower.</p>

<p>I moved here in 2013 from another tiny town in Washington, after my partner got into UNC’s Audiology program to pursue her clinical doctorate. </p>

<p>As with any moves to new places without knowing much, I was scared, excited, intimidated, and a bit lonely. Aside from my partner, I knew no one. I’m a freelancer, so I don’t typically have a social work environment. I looked up meetup groups to try to make friends. I went on a mountain bike ride with TORC, and quickly learned they had a different riding style than mine. David Housekeeper, the group’s leader, recommended I check out a shop in town called Back Alley Bikes, he said some of them went on rides in town periodically and that I might enjoy their company. I had already been in once and got a little intimidated by the tats and the locals-only vibe.</p>

<p>Despite this, I walked by the shop, and wondered whether or not to walk in, and saw a few guys with bikes outside— one of them had a bmx bike. His name was Neal. I timidly approached them and said hey, I just moved to town, and I also ride BMX. I figured they would tell a nerd to get lost, and I could go back to living out my lonely existence. But this was not the case. They were going for beers, they invited me, we talked, exchanged numbers, went on rides, became friends. </p>

<p>One afternoon, Neal and I were bored and thought about making something in town that could be fun to ride. We didn’t have any money to spend, so we looked around for scrap wood we could use. We found some plywood, some 2x4’s 2x6’s and went over to his friend Gabe’s house. Gabe is a carpenter and had a bunch of tools. We got to work. We made a ramp and rode it for hours. People came through the neighborhood to check it out.</p>

<p>We pondered the possibilities over some cheap beers and struck an idea:</p>

<p>What if we built a bunch of these out of trash? 
and invited people from all over?!
and put up flyers around town?!
There were obviously some logistical issues.</p>

<ul class="blue">
  <li> thing </li>
  <li> thing </li>
  <li> thing </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="markdown">markdown</h1>

<p>Where do we put them all?
Will anyone try to stop us?
Is there enough free wood to get it done?</p>

<p>Answers to question 1 and 2 were solved upon the mere suggestion of the idea to one Jason Merrill, a proprietor of Back Alley Bikes and bigger proprietor of do first, and ask questions later. 
Do it at the shop! I’ve got insurance.
Question 3 was answered with a resounding yes when we found some neighborhood skaters taking apart a rotting half pipe in their backyard.
We continued to scrap, move wood, build, ask for donations to get screws, and people got really excited. More people came to help build and more people heard about our plans.
What blew my mind was when Steve Crandall, founder of FBM bmx and mastermind of events just like the one we were building showed up in the parking lot the night before the first jam. For me, it was saying hi to a person you feel like you’ve known forever and meeting a legend all at once.
Lots of people showed up to ride, but what was really special and humbling, was that even more showed up to watch and hang out. The most interesting part of the event was watching children, parents, and grandparents who had literally no previous connection to bmx or bicycles thoroughly enjoy what we had built. To many it’s just a day, and a little event, but to me, it’s one of the more profound moments of art and beauty I’ve ever experienced. It’s free, it’s love, it’s pain, it’s mistakes it’s punk rock and it’s upcycled!</p>

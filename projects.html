          <p>After long periods of rapid experimentation, the technical platforms powering Lyft's user-facing Help experiences began to hit their outer limits. I was hired to lead a 6-month strategic design effort to orient and facilitate this re-build. Over the last 6 months, I worked with partners across product, science, research, engineering, and operations to craft sequenced vision for cross-platform Help at Lyft&mdash;prototyping new features for internal dialogue and user-testing, informing the re-architecture to accommodate future needs, and establishing new metrics and measurement tools for quality and user sentiment.</p>
          <p>I worked end-to-end on many touchpoints of the experience, including educational content, automated help workflows, and communication tools. A critical part of my work has been providing unique outside perspective, but learning from others and ideas that have come before: constantly testing and validating commonly held assumptions. I managed this with a combination of diligent questioning and listening, facilitating feature-concepting workshops with multiple product teams, developing decision-making frameworks, and executing designs of various fidelity to help other team members collaborate and navigate unknowns.</p>

          <p>Canvas, backed by Ford, sought to rethink car ownership with a flexible and fair alternative. They offered a Car-as-a-service model: with subscriptions by the month, including insurance and maintenance, with all-online document processing and checkout and free delivery to your doorstep.</p>
          <p>I was hired 6 weeks before the launch of their MVP product, and led the design of the canvas website and top-of-funnel experience throughout the company’s life, informing the foundational business model, brand positioning, and design system. I wore many hats while there &mdash; engineering the first few versions of our homepage and static web content, and making contributions to our CSS libraries.</p>
          <p>Working with limited resources, I led user-research and testing sessions to validate tweaks to our subscription offerings and designs, continually working with partners in product, marketing, and analytics to define and target metrics for future design iterations. I also led the design of features for our web-app including a premium offering with the Lincoln brand, promotions, referrals, and subscription management tools in our customer dashboard.</p>
          <p>I helped contribute to the company’s design, product, and hiring processes throughout my tenure. I also had the honor of designing our office &mdash; twice.</p>
          <p>We were fortunate to earn a <a href="https://sfdesignweek.org/award-winners/urban-mobility-2/" target="_blank">Design award for Urban Mobility</a> from SF Design Week. In September 2019, Canvas was acquired by <a href="https://fair.com">Fair</a>.</p>

          <p>I was hired as a consultant to evaluate and iterate on their core customer-facing product after their series A round. Along the way, I helped inform their design hiring process and make their first critical design hire. I developed a foundational design system and baseline of user research through field studies with their customers. I also advised and created guidelines for their team members to conduct unbiased field research on their own in the future. I observed and identified user behaviors that might impact their ML models and strategized solutions to improve accuracy of data input. I worked directly with their COO and Director of Product Engineering to make contributions to their product planning processes and roadmap.</p>

          <p>Over the years, I have designed & developed websites for humble nonprofits and small businesses. Apart from the rewards of helping friends & good people, it affords me opportunities to learn and experiment with emerging web technologies, and reminds me of the value of simplicity, which in turn helps me better communicate with engineering partners in my product work. These are a few I'm particularly fond of.</p>

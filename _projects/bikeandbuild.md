### Context

Back in 2012, I signed up for a cross country bicycle ride in support of affordable housing with an organization called [Bike & Build](http://bikeandbuild.org). Through service-oriented cycling trips, Bike & Build benefits affordable housing and empowers young adults for a lifetime of service and civic engagement. So I read up on affordable housing, designed &amp; printed some shirts, built a small [fundraising website](http://alexbloom.us) and took the trip. It was the time of my life&mdash;and later I was given the opportunity to design the majority of the organization's marketing collateral from 2013&ndash;2015. This included Jerseys, Brochures, and Annual Reports. I helped the organization unify their visual brand and shift from their existing PDF format into a responsive, web-based version.

## 2015

For 2016 the torch of the Jersey was passed to Danielle Raynal. She crushed it, btw.

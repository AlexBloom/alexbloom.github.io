    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>In January of 2014, I fell into one of the most interesting places and projects I've ever been able to work on. I was approached by Will Honea, the founder of the Market and a team of highly-dedicated people with uniquely focused experience in farming and market operations. They had little aesthetic direction other than a few key facts—
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sedro-Woolley experienced it's heyday in the 1920's.</li>
      <li>It had a deep history of logging.</li>
      <li>It's people have little tolerance for bourgeois food, and the prices that come with it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I dove into the town's museum, talked with the founders, the mayor, and countless others, and uncovered a treasure chest of historical images and reference points.
    </p>
    <p>I served as the market's sole creative director for 6 months, engaged at pre-incorporation stage through the market's first 50 hired employees. I oversaw, and in many cases— physically executed all aspects of the markets brand strategy,  identity, packaging, interior, exterior, and digital design.

    <h3>About Sedro Woolley</h3>
    <p>Sedro Woolley is a town in Northwestern Washington. It's the birthplace of Darius Kinsey—creator of some of the most iconic logging photos in American history. It's got more farms than anyone knows what to do with.
      Sedro-Woolley, Washington is located in the middle of the Skagit Valley, which has one of the highest concentrations of farms per square mile in the entire evergreen state. It's land feeds the greater Seattle metropolitan area —and yet—the nearest available vendor of local food was 30 miles away in Mt. Vernon. The promise of a market with decent food for the people of the Upper Skagit Valley was a big, big deal, and when people caught wind of what was going on at Market & State street, the pressure was on to deliver.
    </p>

    <p>As with much of America, the 1920's was a particularly bright time for Sedro-Woolley. Hand painted signs and street markers from the era are still visible on the storefronts and streets that boomed for the better part of two decades. Many of them were faded representations of a time gone by, but their replacements were equally bleak. Hastily produced vinyl-printed monstrosities hung over most of the active businesses, and we knew that we had to honor the town's tradition of craftsmanship and hand-made pride in it's signage and visual identity.</p>
    <p>    I worked closely with True Hand Society to develop a brand tapestry of marks that combined these pillars and represented the essence of this hard-working, tough-talking town.</p>

    <h3>The Brand:</h3>

    <p>The brand philosophy echoes that of the market's ideas on food: Give people something simple and good - and don't bullshit them about its benefits or origin. We dropped the typical language of a natural foods market and opted for something a bit more blunt. To the majority of people of Sedro-Woolley, words like "Organic" and "Sustainable" just say "expensive". Local was and always will be the center of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>In every aspect of the brand, we looked to the town's history for solutions. This had to honor yesterday, while being honest about today. After a deep discovery phase with the market's founding and investment teams, visits to the local history museum, and some quality time with a book of postcards collected by the town's Mayor— we developed a conceptual and visual direction for the market that put the town's history and locality first.
    </p>
    <p>The Market's plan was to be a figurative and literal cornerstone of economic and cultural growth and revitalization for Sedro-Woolley's downtown business corridor, which had seen decades of decay and frequent business abandonment. The purchase of the largest historic building on the corner of Main & State Streets, set the tone.
    </p>

    <h3>Mammoth Dreams</h3>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/projects/woolleymarket/brand/logo-tusks.gif" alt="" />

    <p>We played with variations of a Woolley "Mammoth" character, an homage to the coop living space in which many of the town's Movers & Shakers, as well as the market's principle employees and influencers called home.
    </p>

    <h3>Logging is Life</h3>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/projects/woolleymarket/brand/logo-saw.gif" alt="" />
    <p>The logging influence is visible everywhere, the town's streets are marked by chainsaw totems carved each year at the town's "Loggerodeo", it's people have been loggers for more than 3 generations, and it's is the home of Darius Kinsey: the most prolific logging photographer in American history. Naturally, we had to incorporate a rough hewn aesthetic into it's feeling.

    <h2>Print & Packaging:</h2>
    <p>As with any startup, particularly in the food industry, budget was a real concern for packaging, labels, and all printed collateral within the market. I had to be strategic about distribution of spend, reusable components, and flexible & modular systems. We kept things simple and sound with plain boxes and cups and DIY stamps.

    <p>I designed & built templates for menus, price tags, produce, in-store signage & labeling, and left usable indesign files for future employees.
    </p>

    <h2>Special Items:</h2>
    <p>It's Main Street After All— so we got to work on a few things for parades and special town events, like this 1919 Model-T Farm truck that was donated by a principal market investor:</p>

    <p>"Golden Tickets" for free tours of the market pre-opening that were handed out in wrapping foil of lunch sandwiches served at the town's  "Blast from the Past" vintage car show and festival.

context: In 2012, I took a <a href="http://alexbloom.us">cross-country cycling trip</a> in support of affordable housing with an organization called <a href="http://bikeandbuild.org">Bike &amp; Build</a>. It was the time of my life. A year later I was given the opportunity to design the majority of the organization's marketing collateral. This included Jerseys, Brochures, and Annual Reports. I helped the organization unify their visual brand and shift from their existing PDF report into a responsive, web-based version. </p>

  <h3 class="fw-700">Annual Report - 2015</h3>
  <p>The 2015 iteration was a collaborative effort with <a href="http://spenhar.com">Spencer Harrison</a> at Morf Studio.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-700">The Challenge</h3>
  <p class="h5 measure"> Our goal was to tell the story of a year in Bike and Build to brand new audiences, program alumni board members alike. It's a tricky balance explaining the year's specific successes and milestones, but also what the organization does at the most basic level in the same flow. </p>

    <h3 class="fw-700">Architecting the Content</h3>
    <p class="h5 measure"> We recieved an initial content delivery consisting of a word doc, excel sheet of finances, and dropbox folder of photos. We employed a card-sorting method to quickly experiment with different user-flows, ultimately discovering a storyline that wasn't obvious from reading the document.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-700"> Story as Journey </h3>
    <p class="h5 measure">  After a few iterations, we opted to prototype a story-line scroll pattern with the options to jump ahead to audited financials and actionable items. From within the story timeline, we used a simple visual separation of red boxes for deeper dives into non-sequential content, including explanations about Bike & Build and testimonials. </p>

  <h3 class="fw-700">Seeing Red, White, & Blue.</h3>
  <p class="h5 measure">Every year photography is a challenge for the report - There are thousands of beautiful images taken by participants but they vary greatly due to unique cameras, settings, and filters. We really wanted the year's photography and layout to sing harmoniously, and ultimately this required absolute color minimization. Duotones drove the aesthetic and visual language and synced with the typography.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-700">It’s not a race, but load time is.</h3>
    <p class="h5 measure">  We developed a custom single-purpose-class CSS library to accelerate our prototyping workflow and keep our codebase performant. We employed wow.js and animate.css for transitions and most of our scroll-based animations. Chart.js and canvas powered our data visualizations.</p>

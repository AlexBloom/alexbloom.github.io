context: In 2012, I took a <a href="http://alexbloom.us">cross-country cycling trip</a> in support of affordable housing with an organization called <a href="http://bikeandbuild.org">Bike &amp; Build</a>. It was the time of my life. A year later I was given the opportunity to design the majority of the organization's marketing collateral. This included Jerseys, Brochures, and Annual Reports. I helped the organization unify their visual brand and shift from their existing PDF report into a responsive, web-based version. </p>

  <h3 class="fw-700">Annual Report - 2015</h3>
  <p>The 2015 iteration was a collaborative effort with <a href="http://spenhar.com">Spencer Harrison</a> at Morf Studio.</p>
</div>
<div class="cf pad-b-xl">
  <h3 class="fw-700">The Challenge</h3>
  <p class=" measure"> Our goal was to tell the story of a year in Bike and Build to brand new audiences, program alumni, and board members alike. We had to explain the year's specific successes and milestones, as well as the organization's broad offerings in the same flow. </p>

  <div class="col col-12 m-col-6 pad-m mar-t-l">
    <h3 class="fw-700">Architecting the Content</h3>
    <p class=" measure"> We received an initial content delivery consisting of a word doc, excel sheet of finances, and dropbox folder of photos. We employed a card-sorting method to quickly experiment with different content types, ultimately discovering a storyline that wasn't obvious from reading the outlined document.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-700"> Story as Journey </h3>
    <p class=" measure"> After a few iterations, we selected a promising pattern that told the story of how Bike &amp; Build operates, supported by key metrics. We prototyped a long-scrolling story, with options to skip to audited financials and actionable items. From within the story, we employed red boxes for simple visual separation of deeper dives into non-sequential content, including explanations about Bike & Build and testimonials. </p>

    <h3 class="fw-700"> The Final UI </h3>
    <p> We used a simple rhythm of icon, fact, data, supporting info and related image to tell the key story. </p>
  </div>

<div class="float-center m-col-6 pad-b-xl">
  <h3 class="fw-700">Seeing Red, White, & Blue.</h3>
  <p class=" measure">Every year photography is a challenge for the report - There are thousands of beautiful images taken by participants but they vary greatly due to unique cameras, settings, and filters. We really wanted the year's photography and layout to sing harmoniously, and ultimately this required absolute color minimization. Duotones drove the aesthetic and visual language and synced with the typography.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-700">It’s not a race, but load time is.</h3>
    <p class="measure">  We developed a custom single-purpose-class CSS library to accelerate our prototyping workflow and keep our codebase performant. We employed wow.js and animate.css for transitions and most of our scroll-based animations. Chart.js and canvas powered our data visualizations.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-700">Results</h3>
  <p class="measure">What started as an audited financial document for public records has grown into one of the most important marketing tools for the organization, helping boost donations, new corporate partnerships, and rider participation.</p>

    <p>I was contracted to design Bike & Build's Jersey's from 2013&ndash;2015, I simplified the color palette and pushed toward a simplified graphic structure for each.</p>

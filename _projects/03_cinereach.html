context:
  - Cinereach approached me for UX consulting and development on a redesign of their flagship website and film archive. Like many organizations, they were struggling to finalize agreement on design direction. Their in-house designer was continuously creating beautiful mockups, but stakeholders kept rejecting them, primarily because they did not understand the overall flow of information. I built responsive prototypes that showcased both the overall UX and designs across devices, which accellerated the design process and saved internal billable hours.

<h3 class="fw-600"> The Challenges </h3>
<ul class="measure h5">
  <li> Redesign and modernize an outdated, slow-performing website </li>
  <li> Improve the grant application process</li>
  <li> Create an archive with powerful search and sorting tools for a massive library of films, each with it's own unique, and complex data</li>
  <li> Develop the website on a secure, maintainable open-source platform</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="fw-600">Research</h3>
<p class="measure h5">Cinereach offers grants. The team came to me with recurring reports of phone calls and filmmakers who couldn't find key information about applying for grants. I reviewed analytics reports, 401 redirect files, and archived sitemaps to get a better understanding of the site's structure through time. </p>
<p class="measure h5">Over the years, urls changed but were saved in old bookmarks. A simple 301 redirects was a huge first step in improving the user experience&mdash;mapping content over time and planning for growth became major considerations in the new build.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="fw-600"> In Need of Clearer Understanding </h3>
<p class="measure small mar-b-l"> Their initial sitemap didn't articulate the flow of content between page views, or the organizational systems for the films archive. They had plans to sort films by date, type, director, themes, and more, but no way to explain how these loops worked to their internal team. </p>

</div>
<p class="h3">Diving Deeper</p>
<p class="measure small mar-b-l"> I developed a sitemap that articulated every possible user pathway and showed both urls, content structure, and development notes on each page &amp; view node, so that any stakeholder or future creative partner could quickly understand the user facing and technical architecture in tandem.</p>

<p class="h3">Motion â€” The Forgotten Answer</p>
<p class="measure">Prototypes are express lanes to clear conversations. Early in the process, the internal team repeatedly requested more visual impact and dynamism, but this is because they couldn't see fluid animation or interaction. As soon as we started to show motion in prototypes, the requests for complex illustrations reduced, and the simple nature of the site correlated to elegance, rather than dullness.</p>

<h3 class="fw-600"> The Challenges </h3>
<ul class="measure ">
  <li> Redesign and modernize an outdated, slow-performing website </li>
  <li> Improve the grant application process </li>
  <li> Create an archive with powerful search and sorting tools for a massive library of films with multiple taxonomies</li>
  <li> Develop the website on a secure, maintainable, open-source platform</li>
</ul>

  <div class="col-12 m-col-8 float-center">
  <h3 class="fw-600">Research</h3>
  <p class="measure">One of Cinereach's core offerings is grants to independent filmmakers. The team came to me with recurring reports of phone calls and emails from filmmakers who couldn't find key information about applying for grants. I reviewed their analytics, and generated sitemaps, to get a better understanding of the site's changes over time. </p>
  <img class="shadow mar-b-l" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/projects/cinereach/redirects.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="measure">It turned out that as the site had grown and evolved, many critical urls had changed but weren't mapping correctly. A simple set of 301 redirects was a huge first step in improving the user experience. Planning for growth, migrating past content, and creating flexible structures for new content with regards to SEO were major considerations in the new build.</p>

  <div class="m-col-6 float-center">
    <h3 class="fw-600"> Pieces of a Whole </h3>
    <p class="mar-b-l"> Their initial sitemap didn't articulate the flow of content between page views, or the organizational systems for the films archive. They had plans to sort films by date, type, director, themes, and more, but no way to explain how these sorting methods worked to their internal team. </p>

  <div class="m-col-6 float-center">
    <h3 class="fw-600">Connecting the Dots</h3>
    <p class="measure small mar-b-l"> I developed a sitemap that articulated every possible user pathway and showed both urls, content structure, and development notes on each page &amp; view node, so that any stakeholder or future creative partner could quickly understand the user facing and technical architecture in tandem.</p>

  <div class="col col-12 m-col-4 pad-t-xl">
    <h3 class="fw-600"> The Feedback Loop </h3>
    <p>The in-house marketing team was stuck in the twilight zone. They were revising strategy and producing beautiful mockups&mdash;but every solution was getting rejected again and again.</p>
    <p>This was for two primary reasons: first, the executive team could not interpret the overall content structure from the standalone mockups. Second, they had trouble prioritizing their concerns because their use-cases and subsequent flows were not clearly defined.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-600">The Prototype&mdash;An express lane to approval</h3>
    <p>I built a responsive, clickable prototype in code, to showcase the user flow and layout across devices, resulting in an accellerated internal design process and saving internal billable hours.
    </p>
    <p>Early in our process, the stakeholder team repeatedly requested more visual impact and dynamism, but this is because they couldn't see fluid animation or interaction. As soon as we started to show motion in prototypes, the requests for complex illustrations reduced, and the simple nature of the site correlated to elegance, rather than dullness.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-600">Building & Documenting Management Tools</h3>
    <p>They needed a suite of tools to easily edit their custom data for films. Which required extensive editing of the Wordpress Core. We needed to plan for this content upfront because the migration of the film archive data was far too big for manual entry, and we needed to map the old fields for a CSV export.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-600"> Relational Taxonomies </h3>
    <p class=""> Each film had 3 custom taxonomies that linked to archives.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Status</strong> - The availability of the release</li>
      <li><strong>Type</strong> - Non Fiction Fiction or Hybrid</li>
      <li><strong>Year</strong> - The year the film was released. This required special attention to navigate WordPress' default Year taxonomy. </li>

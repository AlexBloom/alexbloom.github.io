  Reduce - Reduce - Reduce
  Don't promise the impossible.

  #1: Make everything understandable for the entire team.
  Technical, Visual, Functional. It all needs to be mapped and it all needs to be explained.
  #2: Explore independently, but if you like something, leave nothing to interpretation.
  #3: Performance Matters.
  #4: Workflow Matters.
  #5: Testing Matters.

  Prototypes are express lanes for clear conversation.

  Two heads are better than one.

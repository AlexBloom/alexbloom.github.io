context:
  - Cinereach approached me for UX consulting and development on a redesign of their flagship website and film archive. Like many organizations, they were struggling to finalize agreement on design direction. Their in-house designer was continuously creating beautiful mockups, but stakeholders kept rejecting them, primarily because they did not understand the overall flow of information. I built responsive prototypes that showcased both the overall UX and designs across devices, which accellerated the design process and saved internal billable hours.

<p class="h2">Impressions</p>
<p class="measure small mar-b-l"> Their initial sitemap didn't articulate the flow of content between page views, or the organizational systems for the films archive. They had plans to sort films by date, type, director, themes, and more, but no way to explain how these loops worked to their internal team. </p>

<p class="h2">Reality</p>
<p class="measure small mar-b-l"> The sitemap I developed articulated every possible user pathway and showed both urls, content structure, and development notes on each page &amp; view node, so that any stakeholder or future creative partner could quickly understand the user facing and technical architecture in tandem.</p>

<p class="h2">Motion â€” The Forgotten Answer</p>
<p class="measure">Prototypes are express lanes to clear conversations. Early in the process, the internal team repeatedly requested more visual impact and dynamism, but this is because they couldn't see fluid animation or interaction. As soon as we started to show motion in prototypes, the requests for complex, heavy illustrations reduced and the simple nature of the site correlated to elegance, rather than dullness.</p>

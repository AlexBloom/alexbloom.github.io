Cinereach approached me in 2014 after seeing a website I had designed &amp; built for Tribeca Film Institute. They had a great in-house visual designer who was formally trained in print design but didn't have much UX experience. This was one of the first projects where I was developer first and designer second, but it taught me a lot of important lessons.

Reduce - Reduce - Reduce

Don't promise the impossible.

#1: Make everything understandable for the entire team.
Technical, Visual, Functional. It all needs to be mapped and it all needs to be explained.
#2: Explore independently, but if you like something, leave nothing to interpretation.
#3: Performance Matters.
#4: Workflow Matters.
#5: Testing Matters.

Prototypes are express lanes for clear conversation.

Two heads are better than one.

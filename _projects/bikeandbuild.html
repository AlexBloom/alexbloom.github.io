Back in 2012, I signed up for a cross country bicycle ride in support of affordable housing with Bike & Build.
I read up on affordable housing, designed &amp; printed some shirts, built <a href="http://alexbloom.us" target="_blank">a small fundraising website</a> and went on the trip.

It was the time of my life and I met my current partner of 4 years.
I was given the opportunity to design the majority of the organizations marketing collateral from 2013-2015, including Jerseys, brochures, and annual reports.


I encouraged them to reconsider the PDF format of their report and opt for a responsive, web-based version.

2015

This annual report was a joint effort at Morf Studio. You can read more about the process here.

Bike & Build Annual Report - 2015
What started as an audited financial document has grown into one of the most important marketing tools for the organization, helping drive donations, partnerships, and rider participation.

About Bike & Build: Through service-oriented cycling trips, Bike & Build benefits affordable housing and empowers young adults for a lifetime of service and civic engagement

Our goal was to tell the story of a year in Bike and Build—to brand new audiences and seasoned board members alike. It's a tricky balance explaining the year's specific successes and milestones, but also what the organization does at the most basic level in the same flow
Architecting the Content
We used a card sorting method to quickly experiment with different combinations of the content. This allowed us to discover a storyline that wasn't obvious at first glance. Fancy paper for the cards is key.

Story as Journey
After a few iterations, we opted to prototype a story-line scroll pattern with the options to jump ahead to audited financials and actionable items. From within the story timeline, we used a simple visual separation of red boxes for deeper dives into non-sequential content; including explanations about Bike & Build and testimonials.

Seeing Red, White, & Blue.
Every year photography is a challenge for the report - There are thousands of beautiful images taken by participants but they vary greatly due to unique cameras, settings, and filters. We really wanted this year's photography and layout to sing harmoniously, and ultimately this required absolute color minimization. Duotones drove the aesthetic and visual language and synced with the typography.

It’s not a race, but load time is.
We developed a custom single-purpose-class css library to accelerate our prototyping workflow, and we employed wow.js and animate.css for transitions and most of our scroll-based animations. Chart.js and canvas powered our data visualizations.

A Dynamic Routemap
We created an SVG map from illustrator and used custom css animations to keep things nice and crisp, while maintaining performance and fast rendering.

Everything is on Github if you want to take a peek.


For 2016 the torch of the Jersey was passed to Danielle Raynal. She crushed it, btw.

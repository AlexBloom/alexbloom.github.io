<h3 class="fw-600"> The Challenges </h3>
<ul class="measure ">
  <li> Redesign and modernize an outdated, slow-performing website </li>
  <li> Improve the grant application process </li>
  <li> Create an archive with powerful search and sorting tools for a massive library of films with multiple taxonomies</li>
  <li> Develop the website on a secure, maintainable, open-source platform</li>
</ul>

  <div class="col-12 m-col-8 float-center">
  <h3 class="fw-600">Research</h3>
  <p class="measure">One of Cinereach's core offerings is grants to independent filmmakers. The team came to me with recurring reports of phone calls and filmmakers who couldn't find key information about applying for grants. I reviewed analytics reports, archived sitemaps, and the current site architecture to get a better understanding of the site's changes over time. </p>
  <img class="shadow pad-b-l" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/projects/cinereach/redirects.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="measure">It turned out that as the site had evolved over the years, many urls had changed, but redirects weren't in place to help users find the content they needed. A simple set of 301 redirects was a huge first step in improving the user experience. Planning for growth and migrating past content with regards to SEO were major considerations in the new build.</p>

  <div class="m-col-6 float-center">
    <h3 class="fw-600"> Pieces of the Picture </h3>
    <p class="mar-b-l"> Their initial sitemap didn't articulate the flow of content between page views, or the organizational systems for the films archive. They had plans to sort films by date, type, director, themes, and more, but no way to explain how these loops worked to their internal team. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Like many organizations, they were struggling to finalize agreement on design direction.

Approval is everything.

Their in-house designer was continuously at the drawing board and producing beautiful mockups, but the executive team rejected every solution. This was twofold:
they did not understand the overall flow of information
concerns were not prioritized in a way that allowed them to come to agreement.
board room argument loops became the designers recurring nightmare

I built responsive, clickable prototypes in code, to showcase the user flow and layout across devices, resulting in an accellerated internal design process and ultimately saving internal billable hours. -->

  <div class="col col-12 m-col-4 pad-t-xl">
    <h3 class="fw-600">Documentation</h3>
    <p>They needed a suite of tools to easily edit their custom data for films. We needed to plan for this content upfront because the migration of the data was too big for manual entry, and we needed to map the fields for a CSV export.</p>

    <h3 class="fw-600"> Relational Taxonomies </h3>
    <p class=""> Each film had 3 custom taxonomies that linked to archives.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Status</strong> - The availability of the release</li>
      <li><strong>Type</strong> - Non Fiction Fiction or Hybrid</li>
      <li><strong>Year</strong> - The year the film was released. This required special attention to navigate WordPress' default Year taxonomy. </li>

    <h3 class="fw-600">Connecting the Dots</h3>
    <p class="measure small mar-b-l"> I developed a sitemap that articulated every possible user pathway and showed both urls, content structure, and development notes on each page &amp; view node, so that any stakeholder or future creative partner could quickly understand the user facing and technical architecture in tandem.</p>

<h3>Motion â€” The Secret Sauce</h3>
<p class="measure">Prototypes are express lanes to clear conversations. Early in the process, the internal team repeatedly requested more visual impact and dynamism, but this is because they couldn't see fluid animation or interaction. As soon as we started to show motion in prototypes, the requests for complex illustrations reduced, and the simple nature of the site correlated to elegance, rather than dullness.</p>

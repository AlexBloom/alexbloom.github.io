There is no shortage of important data when it comes to real estate, but determining which data needs to be visible to a user is a tricky task. We designed an intuitive onboarding experience with search and lifestyle filters, to work with an algorithm that distilled all the relevant data into one number &mdash; a Hausmatchâ„¢. Users can understand whether a property is worth their research at a glance, and greatly reduce the time it takes to find a property worth touring and ultimately buying.

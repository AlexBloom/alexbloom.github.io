A dump of mostly everything I've made since roughly 2006, in reverse chronological order.

### FORT FRANKLIN BUSINESS CARDS

Proposed redesign of the Fort Franklin business cards. In conjunction with the humorous and adventurous identity of the agency, each card featured a custom illustration based upon a phrase or topic of its owner's choosing. Sadly, these never went into production as Fort Franklin was acquired shortly after the designs were finalized.
